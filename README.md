==========

A karotz host callback site to operate the functions of a Karotz device.

This site receives requests from the Karotz Servers to create an interactive id which allows web requests to be sent from a client side app.

I don't really understand this yet but these pages are supposed to help:

    http://dev.karotz.com/dev/register_app.html
    http://dev.karotz.com/api/#Example-of-php-callback
    http://dev.karotz.com/dev/screen.html
    http://dev.karotz.com/api/interactiveid.html

The goal is to experiment with the Karotz remote api.
